# ðŸ©º Stroke Risk Analysis Using DBMS

This project focuses on identifying key factors influencing stroke by building a normalized relational database and performing analysis using SQL and Python. The aim is to demonstrate how structured health data can support evidence-based healthcare decisions.

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

Designed and implemented a relational database schema (up to BCNF) for stroke-related patient data. The schema includes key entities such as **Patient**, **Conditions**, **Metrics**, **Lifestyle**, and **Location**. The data was queried using SQL, and analysis was done in Python with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to extract patterns and visualize stroke risk factors.

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

- Stroke patients had significantly higher average glucose levels and BMI  
- Highest stroke prevalence was among private sector employees and non-smokers  
- Urban areas recorded more stroke cases compared to rural regions
